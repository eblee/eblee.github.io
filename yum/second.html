<h2>Directions</h2> 


		<div class="dir">
		<p>1. In a medium saucepan, cover potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch pieces, with 2 inches salted water. Bring to a boil; reduce to a rapid simmer and cook until potatoes are tender but not falling apart, 15 minutes. Drain potatoes and set in strainer over pot to dry.</p>
		<p>2. In a large nonstick skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium-high. Add one-third the potatoes to pan and shake pan to arrange potatoes in one layer. Cook potatoes, without stirring, until crisp and golden on one side, then gently turn and cook until golden on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes total. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat twice with remaining potatoes, adding 2 tablespoons oil for each batch.</p>
