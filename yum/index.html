<h1>Baked Figs in Lemon Syrup</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
	<li>1/2 cup water</li>
	<li>3 lemons</li>
	<li>1/2 cup and 2 tsp sugar</li>
	<li>1 tbs unsalted butter</li>
	<li>softened 1 1/2 pounds purple figs</li>
 </ul>
<h2>Directions</h2> 
 	<ol>
		<li>Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit</li>
		<li>Boil water and 1/2 cup sugar in a small saucepan, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Remove syrup from the heat. Squeeze enough juice from the 2 lemons to measure 1/3 cup and stir into syrup, then discard the remaining lemon halves.</li>
		<li>Remove the zest from the remaining lemon in long strips with a vegetable peeler. Cut the zest lengthwise into thin julienne strips. Reserve the remaining lemons.</li>
		<li>Blanch zest in a saucepan of boiling water 1 second, then drain in a sieve and add to syrup. Cut away any remaining pith from lemon. Working over a bowl, cut segments free from membranes.</li>
		<li>Spread the butter in a 10-inch heavy oven proof skillet. Arrange the firm-ripe purple figs, cut sides up, slightly overlapping in 1 layer. Sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar and bake until figs are softened and begin to exude juice but still hold their shape, 25 to 30 minutes. When done, transfer figs with a slotted spoon to a shallow serving bowl and put the skillet over a burner at a moderately high heat.</li>
		<li>Add syrup and de-glaze skillet by boiling until syrup is reduced to about 3/4 cup, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the lemon segments along with any juices in bowl and pour syrup (with lemon segments) over the figs. Cool the food to either warm or room temperature before serving.</li>
